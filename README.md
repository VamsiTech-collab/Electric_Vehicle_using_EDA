# Project Title:  Unveiling Insights from Electric Vehicle Data!
# Objective : 
+ To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Electric Vehicle data to identify key factors influencing vehicle performance, energy efficiency, battery usage, charging behavior, and consumer preferences.
+  This analysis will help uncover insights that can drive innovation in EV design, optimize battery life, and improve the overall user experience.
# Libraries Used:
+ Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
+ NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
+ Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting the distribution of scores.
+ Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification).
+ Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
+ Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.
# Key areas to explore in EDA for EV:

1. Battery Performance:
   + Analyze factors affecting battery degradation and energy consumption over time.
   + Understand the relationship between driving patterns (speed, distance, terrain) and battery life.
     
2. Charging Behavior:
   + Study patterns in charging frequency, duration, and locations (home, public, fast-charging stations).
   + Examine the impact of charging habits on overall energy efficiency and battery longevity.
     
3. Range Anxiety:
   + Investigate the distribution of driving range for different types of EVs and driving conditions.
   + Analyze how range varies with temperature, vehicle load, and driving habits.
     
4. Energy Consumption:
   + Explore how factors like vehicle weight, speed, air conditioning usage, and weather conditions impact energy consumption.
   + Identify trends in energy usage over time or based on environmental conditions.
     
5. Consumer Preferences:
   + Use data on sales, reviews, or surveys to understand what features (e.g., range, price, design, charging time) are most important to EV buyers.
   + Analyze how these preferences differ across demographic groups (age, income, geography).
     
6. Cost Efficiency:
   + Examine the relationship between EV operational costs (e.g., electricity, maintenance) and traditional fuel vehicles.
   + Explore how government incentives, rebates, or taxes influence EV adoption.
     
7. Environmental Impact:
   + Analyze the reduction in CO2 emissions or fuel consumption achieved through EV adoption.
   + Compare the energy consumption of EVs with traditional vehicles under similar conditions.

# Task : project was to create a racing bar chart : 
+ To compare the production performance of top electric vehicle manufacturers using the given electric vehicles dataset. I have used Python's bar_chart_race module for accomplishing this task.

# Task : Created an interactive Choropleth map : 
+ Using Plotly Express, visualizing the geographical distribution of EVs across regions. The power of data visualization never ceases to amaze!.
